## Game Rules

- In this game, you are playing the snake that eats mushrooms in the garden.
- To move it, use the arrow keys.
- Avoid collisions with the walls and your tail.
- Your main goal is to eat as many mushrooms as you can.
- When you eat all the mushrooms in the garden, you move to another one, which has more of them (there are only 3 gardens you can go to).
- The snake becomes small while moving to the next garden (it takes her a lot of energy to get there), but the score stays the same.
- If you die, you respawn in the next garden.
- When you get to the last, 3rd garden and eat all the mushrooms or die, the game ends.
